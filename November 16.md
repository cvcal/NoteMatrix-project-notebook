# Design notebook for week ending November 16, 2014

## Description

I finalized many design decisions in my 
[design and implementation](https://github.com/cvcal/NoteMatrixWithTonality/blob/master/documents/design_and_implementation.md) 
document. The parts I've added since last week include clarification on how the 
user will interact with the interface, more direct answers to the questions 
posed in the 
[project description](http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~benw/teaching/cs111_fa14/project.html#description) 
and, going along with this, a more careful consideration of possible incorrect 
inputs. I also continued some research for similar DSLs and programs now that I 
have a better idea of what I want to implement.

I have settled on implementing the core of this in Java, though I will keep the 
option of Scala open if part of the project would benefit from the different 
tools that Scala offers. 





**TODO:** Fill in this part with information about your work this week:
important design decisions, changes to previous decisions, open questions,
exciting milestones, preliminary results, etc. Feel free to include images
(e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running program), links to
code, and any other resources that you think will help clearly convey your
design process.


## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

About 2 hours on critique and critique reflection. Another 3.5 hours finishing 
up the design and implementation document.
