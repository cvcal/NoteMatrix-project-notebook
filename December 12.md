# Design notebook for week ending December 7, 2014

## Description

I made my thing work! With caveats:
* You can use the GUI to add/remove notes based on which color is selected,
* You can play the piece (currently it plays 3 times looping, and doesn't 
  update if you change something in the grid, you'll have to play again after 
  it's done.)
* There's also a convenient clear button.
* You cannot choose the instruments yet, these are set ahead of time, before 
  opening up the GUI.

Here's what it looks like empty:
